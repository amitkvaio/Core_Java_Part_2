enum A {
/*
1.	The enumeration concept was introduced in Java version 1.5.
2.	Enums are used to define a group of named constants.
3.	Enums are declared using the enum keyword. The compiler generates .class files for each enum.
4.	The enum keyword is used to define an enum, while Enum is a class. Every enum automatically extends java.lang.Enum, meaning enums cannot inherit from any other class. Therefore, inheritance is not applicable to enums.
5.	Enum constants are, by default, public, static, and final.
